Events and Delegates

-   If instead of sending an empty instance of EventArgs you'd like to send another object reference as an argument, you can do so by
    declaring the object's class as an extension of the EventArgs class. Don't forget to modify every function that expects an EventArgs as an
    argument, you need to change it for the new class' name.

public class VideoEventArgs : EventArgs
{
    public Video Video { set; get; }
}

-   We don't have to create custom delegates, they are two already included in the newer versions of .NET Framework.
    
    EventHandler -> if you don't wish to send additional data.
    // public event EventHandler VideoEncoded;
    
    EventHandler<TEventArgs> -> if you need extra arguments for your methods.
    // public event EventHandler<VideoEventArgs> VideoEncoded;

    Mosh-sensei recommends you use any of these instead.
